      One of the snippet's I picked up from Kent C. Dodds'{' '}

        EpicReact
      </a>{' '}
      course was this super cool useAsync function, and it's a masterclass in
      elegance. There are several patterns I want to call out that he uses here
      that every React dev should know.

        This is a technique to prevent memory leaks if the component unmounts.

      <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
        Running an async function lends itself really well to abstracting more

      I was watching a conversation between Kent and{' '}
      <a href="https://github.com/tannerlinsley" target="_blank">
        Tanner Linsley
      </a>{' '}
      the other day and this hook came up. Tanner confirmed that it uses the
      same patterns as React Query. This means two things:
      <ol style={{ margin: '15px 0 0 0', padding: '0 50px 0 30px' }}>
        <li>
          For most projects you're just going to want to use React Query. The
          caching optimization is second to none and this hook doesn't deal with
          that
        </li>
        <li>
          This code uses patterns that are the gold standard for async handling
          in React, so it is a GREAT topic to dive deeper on
        </li>
      </ol>
    </aside>
    <br />
    <p>
      Without further ado, here's the code for you to skim. We'll break it down
      in a second.

      1. Using a safe dispatch:{' '}
      <span>
        I'm not going to cover this right now because you can find a quick write
        up on it{' '}
        <a href="https://headbutt.io/useSafeDispatch" target="_blank">
          here
        </a>
        . Just know that if you try to set state (dispatch) on an unmounted component,
        you'll have problems. I detail a simple hook guards against that.
      </span>
    </h5>
    <br />
    <h5 style={{ marginLeft: 0 }}>2. Returning a run function</h5>
    <p>
      This one is great. All too often I've seen people return their state
      setting function from their hook without wondering whether it could be
      abstracted further.
    </p>
    <SyntaxHighlighter
      language="jsx"
      style={materialDark}
      customStyle={{ fontFamily: 'Dank Mono', margin: '45px 0' }}
    >
      {stringUseAsync2}
    </SyntaxHighlighter>
    <p>Look familiar? Well it turns out we can do better. Much better.</p>
    <p>
      Let's take a look at the code someone using this hook would have to write:
    </p>
    <SyntaxHighlighter
      language="jsx"
      style={materialDark}
      customStyle={{ fontFamily: 'Dank Mono', margin: '45px 0' }}
    >
      {stringUseAsync3}
    </SyntaxHighlighter>
    <p>
      Something like this. They have to run the fetch themselves, and resolve
      the promise with a dispatch. Is this the end of the world?
    </p>
    <p>Of course not.</p>
    <p>
      But why are we bothering them with our action types? We know everything
      that has to happen when that fetch is called.. Why not do it for them?
    </p>
    <p>Enter Kent's run function:</p>
    <SyntaxHighlighter
      language="jsx"
      style={materialDark}
      customStyle={{ fontFamily: 'Dank Mono', margin: '45px 0' }}
    >
      {stringUseAsync4}
    </SyntaxHighlighter>
    <p>
      We accept a promise, and handle things accordingly when it resolves. All
      of the chaining and worrying about action types has moved from our fellow
      dev's component into our hook. Neat!
    </p>
    <aside>
      Don't forget to throw React.useCallback on their so that they can use it
      as a dependency!
    </aside>
    <p>This is how their implementation looks now:</p>
    <SyntaxHighlighter
      language="jsx"
      style={materialDark}
      customStyle={{ fontFamily: 'Dank Mono', margin: '45px 0' }}
    >
      {stringUseAsync5}
    </SyntaxHighlighter>
    <br />
    <p>
      Beautiful! But what if they need to set state manually? This brings me to
      our third pattern:
    </p>
    <h5 style={{ marginLeft: 0 }}>
      <br />
      3. Returning Setters:{' '}
    </h5>
    <p>
      The run function makes it so we actually <i>NEED</i> to use this pattern,
      but it's a great one to keep in mind even when you don't need it because
      it is more widely applicable than the run function we just went over.
    </p>
    <p>
      We aren't providing our fellow devs a dispatch anymore, so they have no
      way to force state. We need to provide one, so we'll just make some
      setters.
    </p>
    <aside>
      Why would I use this when I don't need it? <br />
      <br />
      Errors are more likely to occur when we make other developers memorize our
      action types. We can do it for them and return easily understandable
      setData and setError functions wrapped in React.useCallback.
      <br />
      <br />
      Would you rather worry about dispatching, or just use a setter? me too :)

      Hopefully you learned something here to help you write hooks a little bit
      more elegantly :)
